"""Registry for managing Genkit resources and actions.

This module provides the Registry class, which is the central repository for
storing and managing various Genkit resources such as actions, flows,
plugins, and schemas. The registry enables dynamic registration and lookup
of these resources during runtime.

Example:
    >>> registry = Registry()
    >>> registry.register_action(my_action)
    >>> action = registry.get_action('my_action')
